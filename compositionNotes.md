# Ideas for baby's composition

I want to do something modular and generative, multi agents that interact in real time and generate a score.

What should be the main concept or theme?

What I am feeling? I want to study form trough code. An interaction between design patterns and musical form. I don't yet know exactly how.. Today I'll know it while I sleep.
